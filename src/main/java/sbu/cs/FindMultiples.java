/*
    In this exercise, you must write a multithreaded program that finds all
    integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7. Return the
    sum of all unique integers as your answer.
    Note that an integer such as 15 (which is a multiple of 3 and 5) is only
    counted once.

    The Positive integer n > 0 is given to you as input. Create as many threads as
    you need to solve the problem. You can use a Thread Pool for bonus points.

    Example:
    Input: n = 10
    Output: sum = 40
    Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are:
    3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

    Use the tests provided in the test folder to ensure your code works correctly.
