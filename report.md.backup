In this assignment I got to know the basic multi thread concept and syntax in java. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

There were 3 classes to be implemented:

* CPU Simulator: Java comparator is used to sort the input arrayList.
* FindMaltiple: In which the threadPool is being used.
* UseInterrupt: To interrupt a thread I used TimerTask and Timer  which are java util classes that we use to schedule tasks in a background thread
