# Multithread Basics

## Introduction
In this assignment, you are given three introductory exercises focused on the basics of multithreading. Solve each exercise according to the provided guidelines.


## Objectives
- Review the concepts of multithreaded programming and utilize them correctly
- Review the different methods of creating threads in java
- Utilize interrupts and debug a program using them
- Familiarize yourself with Thread Pools
- Write a report on the assignment


## Tasks
1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine. Ensure to create a new Git branch before starting your work
2. Complete the following exercises based on the instructions provided:

   - `CPU Simulator`: Simulate a single core CPU and schedule tasks to run on a thread
   - `Find Multiples`: write a multithreaded program to find all integers in a given range that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7. Return the sum of all unique integers.
   - `Use Interrupts`: Analyze the provided code and add interrupts where a thread must be terminated. Handle each interrupt in its respective thread.
3. Commit your changes and push your commits to your fork on Github. Create a pull request (assigned to your mentor) to merge your changes to the main branch of your fork on Github.


## Notes
- You can find unit tests for the first two exercises (`CPU Simulator` and `Find Multiples`). Use these to ensure you've implemented the code correctly.
- You are not allowed to change or delete any existing line of code in the third exercise (`Use Interrupts`). You can only add new code to solve the issues presented in the exercise.
- Your report should focus on the solution you choose for each exercise (and why you chose it). Include any multithreading principles that you used in your report.


## Evaluation
- Your code should compile and run without any errors
- Your code should be well-organized, readable, properly commented and should follow clean code principles
- Your code should pass all of the provided unit tests
- You should use Git for version control and include meaningful commit messages


## Bonus Objectives
1. Expand the `CPU Simulator` exercise by simulating a dual core CPU. Create a separate file for the new simulation. Include details of your implementation in your report. 
2. Learn how to use Thread Pools in Java and solve the `Find Multiples` problem using a Fixed or Cached Thread Pool. Provide adequate explanation regarding Thread Pools and the difference between using a Thread Pool and other thread creation methods.


## Submission
- Push your code to your fork on Github
- Upload your report to your fork on GitHub


The deadline for submitting your code is Wednesday, May 7 (13th of Ordibehesht). Good luck, happy coding and hasta luego!
